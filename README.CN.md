# Dark-Audio Engine

English | [简体中文](./README-CN.md)

## getting Started

It is recommended to use Visual Studio 2017 or 2019. Dark has not been formally tested on other development environments, and we focus on Windows building.

First use git clone `https://github.com/Acmen-Team/Dark-Audio.git` to clone the repository.

If the repository was previously cloned non-recursively, use git submodule update --init to clone the necessary submodules.

## the goal
Dark's plan has two aspects: the creation of a powerful 3D audio engine, and the exploration of the development of next-generation game engines.

## Plan

-Support independent use
-Support Mac, Linux, Android and iOS
-Support 2D 3D sound rendering


## Vision

We hope to use the Dark game engine to make games, and use Dark to develop the appropriate tools needed for the game. Contains the following workflow:

-Use the Dark editor to design game scenes.
-Test the game in Dark, including the function of saving/loading the created game.
-Load and play the game in the sandbox.

We want everyone to be able to play games on all desktop platforms (Windows, Mac and Linux). After the initial iteration, we will try to "use Dark to create a game" to see the engine's operating expectations.
